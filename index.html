					<h4 class="title">Expectations</h4>
					<p>I expect that I’m capable to doing a job about cyber security in the future. For me, this career is much more than an approach to get salary and reputation. It's a job that could be a path to doing great thing to help others while prove myself and get the sense of accomplishment. I would like to protect a company from hackers or protect people's personal information from unscrupulous people. The generation we are live in is the generation with highly developed information technology, I believe the existence of such role to protect others from information security attack is very necessary and proud.</p>

		<br>  <br> 
		<p>
The results provide a scientistic conclusion to me. According to the results, I got a new and clearer understanding of myself. Now, I’m clear about what’s my personality advantages and disadvantages. 
Based on that information, I could develop my future direction to gain benefit and improve my weaknesses. 
</p>
<p>
The test of personalities type shows I am an INFP which also knows as the Healer group. 
I symbols for Introversion, N for iNtuition, F for Feeling and P for Perceiving. Being an introversion means that I’m willing to stay alone rather than spend my time with others. 
As I can’t gain energy from the social activities, I think I will drop some unnecessary social activities for saving me energy. Although I have been classified to iNtuition, the result shows that I’m a bit of both Sensor and Intuitive. 
So, I’m usually using both styles and have able to switch from one to another depends on the demands in the environment I’m in when I am processing information. I believe it’s an advantage in my personality. 
The test classified me as “F” (Feeling) which means I’m a sensitive person. But the result also said that I’m neither an absolute thinker nor a feeler type. So, I’m neither totally on my logical nor emotion when I need to make decisions. 
The last symbol of my personality is “P”, because I like to keep things casual and open-ended. I think this personality explains why I like to change my decisions at the last-minute and it might be the weakness for me. 
Based on this result, I would tend to turn myself more scheduled and organized in the future. 
</p>
<p>
The other test shows that my learning type is visual. It explains that I can gain knowledge better when I read or see pictures. 
In this point, I am going to change my current learning method to be more visually oriented in order to improve my learning efficiency. 
</p>
<p>
For the last test, I have been classified as a romantic person who trade job and behavior as the way to express my inner self. Under those tests’ help, 
I see myself clearer and have some specific directions to change myself. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, the tests indicate that I have great skill in processing information and making decisions and those skills are important for any teamwork. 
And I’m good at analytic of visual resources which can be helpful in a team. Also, I’m kind of person who has imagination and creativity and always has the unique ways to bringing meaning and determination to myself and people around me.

			<h2>Project Ideas</h2>

		<h2 class="mt-0">Overview</h2>

		<p>
			This project is about developing a 2D game using Unity. The name of this game is “Gem Collection”, it’s a puzzle game with cute user interface and adorable background music. The main goal of each level is to collect enough number of gems in limited steps. 
		</p>

		<h2 class="mt-0">Motivation</h2>
		<p>
		The main motivation for me to do this project is that games include many forms of traditional artistic expression, such as illustrations, storyline narrative arcs, and dynamic music. 
		The combination of these artistic expressions can create something that transcends any one type. It is clear that games are where art meets science.
		</p>
		<p>
		Another motivation is that I have always been interested in game development. This was a great opportunity for me to learn and practice my game development skills through this project.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mt-0">Description</h2>


		<h2 class="mt-0">Tools and Technologie</h2>
		<p>
			In order to develop a 2D game, the main and most important equipment is a great computer with hardware that can run Unity on it. 
			The ideally environment would be a Windows computer with operating system Windows 10 with a GPU as we need good quality graphics for the game. 
			We also need an Android phone and an iPhone to test the adaptably of the game to ensure that it can run smoothly on different platforms.
			</p>
			<p>
			As for software, we are going to need Unity as the main tool to develop the game. Visual studio or Visual Studio Code also needed for scripts developing.
